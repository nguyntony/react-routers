      <p>Hello, my name is Tony Nguyen and I am learning about React. This app will be demonstrating how to use Routers and to do that, I will be using the Pokemon API. I'm going to render a 'Shop' and it will display Pokemon images, when you click on the item,  you will go to the details page of that item.</p>
